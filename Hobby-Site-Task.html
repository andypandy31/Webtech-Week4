                    On just another normal Monday, the world changed. The universe had reached a threshold humanity didn’t even know existed,
                    and it was time to finally be integrated into the vast multiverse. 
                    A world where power is the only thing that one can truly rely on.
                    Jake, a seemingly average office worker, finds himself thrust into this new world. 
                    Into a tutorial filled with dangers and opportunities. In a world that should breed fear and concern, 
                    an environment that makes his fellow coworkers falter, Jake instead finds himself thriving.
                    Perhaps… Jake was born for this kind of world, to begin with.

                    A new world with nearly unlimited possibilities. A status, classes, magic and monsters. 
                    Sounds good? Well, for Ilea it didn't come quite as expected as for some other protagonists, 
                    nor was there a king or god to welcome her.
                    The grand quest? Well, she might figure that out someday but for now, a new world with new food is prize enough. 
                    Her fists at the ready, she's prepared to punch and get punched, 
                    however long it takes and however many limbs she might have to regrow.
